<h1>debounce</h1>
<h3>Given a high frequency event triggered by an object, the function will only execute once in N seconds. If the high frequency even</h3>

```javascript
function debounce(fn, duration) {
  const that = this;
  let timeout = null; // Store the return value of timer

  return () => {
    clearTimeout(timeout); // Remove the previous setTimeout

    timeout = setTimeout(() => {
      // make a new setTimeout, If the event is triggered after the event is triggered,do not execute fn function
      fn.apply(that, arguments);
    }, duration || 500);
  };
}
```

<h1>throttle</h1>
<h3>A high-frequency event is triggered, but it will only be executed once in n seconds, so throttling will dilute the execution frequency of the function</h3>

```javascript
function throttle(fn, duration) {
  const that = this;
  let throttle = true;

  return () => {
    if (!throttle) return;
    throttle = false;

    setTimeout(() => {
      fn.apply(that, arguments);

      throttle = true;
    }, duration || 500);
  };
}
```
